# Privacy Policy

**The Kairos Project AI Application Evaluator**  
**Effective:** June 3, 2024

## Data We Process

**What We Don't Collect or Process:**
- We do not collect, store, or process any user data
- We do not have access to your applicant information
- We do not have access to your API keys
- We do not have access to your evaluation criteria or settings
- We don't collect user behavior or analytics
- We don't sell or share any data (because we don't have any)

**How The Extension Works:**
- Runs entirely in your local Airtable environment
- All data processing happens on your machine/browser
- Your data goes directly from your environment to AI providers
- We never see or receive any of your data

## Third-Party Processing

When you use the extension, your configured applicant data is sent directly from your environment to:
- **OpenAI** (for GPT models) - [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/)
- **Anthropic** (for Claude models) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)

This data transmission occurs directly between your Airtable environment and these services - we are not involved in this data flow.

## Data Security

- All settings stored locally in your Airtable base
- All processing happens in your local environment
- API calls use HTTPS encryption (handled by Airtable and AI providers)
- No data storage or processing by us
- You have complete control over all data

## Your Rights

- Full ownership and control over all your data
- We cannot access your data to delete it (because we don't have it)
- Manage API keys directly in your Airtable environment
- Stop processing by disabling or removing the extension
- All data remains in your control at all times

## Legal Basis

We do not process any personal data. All data processing is performed by you in your own environment using the extension as a tool. Any data processing with third-party AI services is governed by your direct relationship with those providers.
